**Important**

Protocol under development!
v-0.1

**Summary**

Measures photosynthesis-related parameters in <5 seconds.

- Chlorophyll Fluorescence: F0, Fm, Fs, Phi2, Fv/Fm, qL, qP, NPQ, PhiNO, PhiNPQ, LEF
- Relative Chlorophyll
- Leaf Thickness (in mm)
- Leaf Temperature and differential from ambient temperature
- Environmental conditions: PAR and ambient temperature/pressure/humidity

**Observations**

- Measurements starts instantaneously.
- This protocol is based on "Photosynthesis RIDES 2.0".
- LEF value would vary depending on the light intensity so that the LEF_no_light is returned to use when working in greenhouse conditions.
- It shows an additional warning when Phi2 is lower than 0.75.
