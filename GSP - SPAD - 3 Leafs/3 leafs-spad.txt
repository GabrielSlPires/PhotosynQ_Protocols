**Important**

This protocol was made to measure 3 leafs in sequence, with two spad measurements per leaf.
Protocol under development!
v-0.1

**Summary**

First measurements of the leaf:
    - Relative Chlorophyll
    - Leaf Thickness (in mm)
    - Leaf Temperature and differential from ambient temperature
    - Environmental conditions: PAR and ambient temperature/pressure/humidity

Second measurements of the leaf:
    - Relative Chlorophyll
    - Leaf Thickness (in mm)
    - Leaf Temperature and differential from ambient temperature
    - Environmental conditions: PAR and ambient temperature/pressure/humidity

The mean values per leaf is the output returned

**Observations**

- Each measurements is controled by a "open/close" action.
- This protocol is based on "Photosynthesis RIDES 2.0".
- LEF value would vary depending on the light intensity so that the LEF_no_light is returned to use when working in greenhouse conditions.
- It shows an additional warning when Phi2 is lower than 0.75.
